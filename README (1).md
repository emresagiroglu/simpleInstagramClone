Welcome to the Swift Instagram Clone project! This project aims to replicate the core features of the Instagram app using Swift programming language and Firebase for backend services.


### User Authentication: 
Users can log in using their email and password. Once logged in, they can access the timeline section.
### Timeline: 
Displays user-shared posts in chronological order. Posts are sorted by date, and users can scroll through their friends' posts.
### Upload: 
Users can share new photos by providing captions. Uploaded photos will appear on their followers' timelines.
### Settings:
Users can log out from their account using the Log Out button in the settings section.
Persistent Login: If a user closes the app without logging out, they won't be prompted for credentials again until they manually log out.
